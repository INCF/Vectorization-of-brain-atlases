Following are some tests defined for each stage:

TEST1 tests the correctness of decoding of png image.
TEST1 = READ png image, print height, print width, print all pixels int values in 
		test_1_cpp.txt by cpp program.
	  = READ png image, print height, print width, print all pixels int values in 
	  	test_1_m.m by octave/matlab script.

TEST2 tests if the popped out boundaries by cpp code is same as that by matlab code

TEST3 = convert back the coded image matrix back to the original popped out boundaries image
		using colour code and check if the two results are same.
		test_3_cpp.txt will be used for this

TEST4 = tests if the control points by cpp code is same as that by matlab code

Following are some evaluations defined:

eval1 = popout boundaries image
eval2 = image with control points
eval3 = image with line segments and island segments black colored and red colored respectively
eval4 = svg with forward and reverse borders
