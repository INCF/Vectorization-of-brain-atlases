Following are some tests defined for each stage:
1. Read Image
	- Write image back and diff should be 0.
1. Popout Boundaries: Assuming Zero indxing of rows and columns (0=Even)
	- Removing even rows and columns and then rebuilding the bitmap should give us the original bitmap.
	- For each white pixel, either up and down or right and left or left up and right down pixel must be different.
TEST1 = READ png image, print height, print width, print all pixels int values in 
		test_1_cpp.txt by cpp program.
	  = READ png image, print height, print width, print all pixels int values in 
	  	test_1_m.m by octave/matlab script.

TEST2 = print height, width and pixel values of popped out boundaries in different 
		different lines in test_2_cpp.txt by cpp program.
	  = print height, width and pixel values of popped out boundaries in different 
		different lines in test_2_m.txt by octave/matlab program.
