A very brief guide to common orientation errors in Nifti1 files
===============================================================

A volumetric brain coordinate system generally has three axes:

1. The Left-Right axis -> X
2. The Posterior-Anterior axis (back to front) -> Y
3. The Inferior-Superior axis (bottom to top) -> Z

In a NIFTI file, the raw data is stored as a three dimensional matrix, where the i, j and k indices correspond to the above 
three axes, but not necessarily in that order. So i may correspond to -Y, j to +Z and k to -X, for example.

A NIFTI file also stores two affine transformation matrices, called sform and qform.
The NIFTI standard requires that these matrices (if present) transform the data to standard axes, which is the above order 
and called RAS: Right-Anterior-Superior. The reason for having both qform and sform is that they could encode two slightly
different transformations, into two different standard spaces for example. It is advised to keep qform and sform identical, 
because many software packages do not distinguish them well.

A problem that I often encounter is that Atlas makers produce NIFTI files that do not adhere to the standard. This is quite
problematic: it is easy to see from the data what is top-bottom and back-front, but there usually is no way to see what is 
left and right. I produced two Python scripts to deal with such files: nii2snapshot.py produces an HTML page that shows a 
few cross sections from which you can check whether the NIFTI file has a proper RAS orientation. The next, nii_reorient.py 
can fix the orientation a NIFTI file. It does not touch the data, only the qform and sform. You specify the requested 
permutation, like -r="-k-i+j" and it will permute the affine matrices accordingly.

A second common problem is that neither qform or sform are present. That can mean two things:
1. the NIFTI file was produced in a quick and dirty way, so you have to figure out the orientation yourself and will not 
know what is Left and Right
2. the NIFTI file is a direct copy of an older file format called ANALYZE.
In that case, the raw data are stored in LAS orientation.
